This is a portion of a group project with the overarching goal of identifying areas with increasing construction demand in the coming years. My personal focus for this project was to identify infrastructure legislation that will impact the construction industry, find data to reach quantitative conclusions, and visualize the relevant data.

The attached Tableau Workbook contains dashboards that can be used to identify cities and states with growing infrastructure funding and particularly poor bridge and road conditions.

A brief overview of the slides is found below:
  - State BIL Profile
    - Shows funding by state from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and which subcategories the funding is allocated to for each state
  - City BIL Profile
    - Shows funding by city from the BIL and which subcategories the funding is allocated to which is also filterable by state
  - State Funding Change
    - Displays percentage change of BIL funding for each state from first iteration of data collection (July 2022) to the last iteration of data collection (October 2022)
  - Programs
    - A table displaying total allocation of BIL funding for each program in the dataset
  - Poor Bridge Sq Area Corr
    - A scatterplot showing the significant positive correlation between poor bridge square area and announced BIL funding
  - County Bridges
    - A map displaying U.S. counties and their reported poor bridge square area
  - MSA Bridges
    - A map displaying metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) and their combined reported poor bridge square area using county data
  - State Road Condition
    - A map displaying the number of "unacceptable miles" of roads in each state
  - MSA IRI Dash
    - A map displaying the number of "poor miles" of roads in each MSA
